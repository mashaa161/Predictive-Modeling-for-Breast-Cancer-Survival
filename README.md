# Predictive-Modeling-for-Breast-Cancer-Survival

Many of us know someone who has battled breast cancer, or at least have heard about the challenges faced by patients fighting this disease. Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women, affecting 2.1 million women annually. It also accounts for the highest number of cancer-related deaths among women. In 2018 alone, an estimated 627,000 women died from breast cancer.

A crucial aspect of clinical decision-making for cancer patients, in general, is accurately predicting the prognosis and survival duration.  Breast cancer patients with the same disease stage and clinical characteristics can exhibit varying treatment responses and overall survival.  Why is this?

Cancers are linked to genetic abnormalities. Gene expression analysis measures the level of gene activity within a tissue, providing insights into its complex functions. Comparing gene expression profiles between normal and diseased tissue can offer valuable information regarding cancer prognosis and outcomes. Utilizing machine learning techniques on genetic data holds the potential to accurately estimate survival time and potentially avoid unnecessary surgical and treatment interventions.

The Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) database is a collaborative Canada-UK project that houses targeted sequencing data from 1,980 primary breast cancer samples. Clinical and genomic data were obtained from cBioPortal.

This dataset was compiled by Professor Carlos Caldas from the Cambridge Research Institute and Professor Sam Aparicio from the British Columbia Cancer Centre in Canada, and published in Nature Communications (Pereira et al., 2016).
